        If you're able to help, please reach out.  We need locals with printers
        who can print out forms - we need people to donate fabric - we need
        folks who can check in on neighbors, if only for a chat.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

    We're doing this in parts - whether it's printing out important medical
    history forms for people that don't have printers to be able to be prepared,
    or getting a little bit of extra thread for all the people sewing masks for
    the community - it all comes together!

      The first time I tried Kaldi’s coffee, I couldn’t even believe that was
      the same thing I’ve been drinking every morning.

      Kaldi is the place to go if you want the best quality coffee. I love their
      stance on empowering farmers and transparency.
