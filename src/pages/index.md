    We love our community, so we're sewing today, not working on the website :)

  When things are bad, sometimes it's hard, or overwhelming to imagine ways of
  making them better as individuals.  We believe that little changes can make
  big impacts, if we can just find the little changes that need to be made to
  make living through a crisis for our community easier.

        In listening to experts, we've learned that Emergency workers say you
        should fill out forms with your personal medical information right now
        in case you or somebody you love is one day hospitalized for COVID-19.


        We also know that no visitors will be permitted to visit while you are
        in the hospital.

        BE PREPARED: We realized that because we're in a crisis, many people
        would not have access to printers to print out and fill out confusing
        personal medical history forms before they are needed in an emergency. 
        This is one change we can do!  We can design a simple form with expert
        help, and get them to our neighbors to fill out and keep in the event
        they need to go to the hospital.

        Another small thing:  We know that many people now need masks to go to
        the grocery store or pharmacy, or even to work as essential personnel. 
        N95 Medical Masks are reserved for medical workers.  We can make good
        quality homemade masks and get them into the community at No Charge
        because we realize so many of our neighbors have lost their jobs.

        We can not only say we care, but show we care - especially as so many
        people are isolated and feeling lonely.
  heading: What we offer our community
  description: >-
    We're a team of volunteers who can get blank medical history forms to
    neighbors for them to fill out and keep a truly stressful emergency arises
    and they (hopefully not) need to go to the Hospital to be treated for
    COVID-19.  We can also provide excellent quality homemade masks to people
    who cannot sew, or afford to buy them for any reasons.  We can not only say
    we care, but show we care.

    Fred Rogers often told this story about when he was a boy and would see
    scary things on the news: “My mother would say to me, ‘Look for the helpers.
    You will always find people who are helping.’ To this day, especially in
    times of disaster, I remember my mother’s words, and I am always comforted
    by realizing that there are still so many helpers — so many caring people in
    this world.”"
