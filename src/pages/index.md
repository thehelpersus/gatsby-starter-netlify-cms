  When things are bad, sometimes it's hard, or overwhelming to imagine ways of
  making them better as individuals.  We believe that little changes can make
  big impacts, if we can just find the little changes that need to be made to
  make living through a crisis for our community easier.

        In listening to experts, we've learned that Emergency workers say you
        should fill out forms with your personal medical information right now
        in case you or somebody you love is one day hospitalized for COVID-19.


        We also know that no visitors will be permitted to visit while you are
        in the hospital.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
