  The CheltenHELPers are a volunteer group of your neighbors who saw a need and
  decided to do something about it.  We are helping all members of our community
  document their medical history in case of an emergency, and providing
  home-made masks for our at-risk neighbors that need this additional bit of
  protection.

**While we're resource bound in this crisis, we'll be working to meet the needs of all on our community.  
At no time will we be recording your medical information, we will only get paper forms to you to fill out or download yourself.**
