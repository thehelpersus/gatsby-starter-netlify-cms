  We've distributed close to 200 masks to medical personnel, essential persons
  and our at risk neighbors.  Today we cut more than 60 new masks to start
  sewing, and are working on getting 3d printed face shields to medical workers
  to, in part, address the supply shortages seen in local hospitals.

While we're resource-bound in this crisis, we'll be working to meet the needs of all on our community.  

We will not, in any way be recording your medical information, we will only get paper forms to you to fill out or digital forms for you to download yourself.**
